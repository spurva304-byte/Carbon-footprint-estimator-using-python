"""values we need :
that day's electricity consumption (kWh)
Cooking fuel usage (LPG cylinders / PNG units)
average ac usage per day (then multiply this by average units consumed by ac then calculate carbon footprint)

Daily travel distance (km)
Mode of transport (bike/car/bus/auto/metro)- we'll use individual vehicle and then use regex to deploy data for different vehicle
Fuel type (petrol/diesel/CNG/electric)
Monthly fuel consumption (litres)
flights taken and for how much distance (first use boolean then if that is true then we go to calculate value)

Diet type (veg / non-veg / vegan)
fast food and junk(people can only tell if yes or no then we take an estimate about how much carbon is emitted)
if non veg then 
meat intake
Packaged food usage


Waste generated daily (we'll ask for bags or a standard dustbin size then use standard values
Approx plastic waste per week (grams)
Daily screen time (hours)
Charging habits (use standard data)
